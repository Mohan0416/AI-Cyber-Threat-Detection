# Vehicle Lane Detection System

## Overview
The **Vehicle Lane Detection System** is a computer vision-based project designed to detect lanes on roads using image processing and deep learning techniques. This system can be integrated into autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance systems to improve road safety.

## Features
- Real-time lane detection
- Edge detection using Canny algorithm
- Region of interest selection
- Hough Transform for lane line detection
- Deep learning-based lane segmentation (optional)
- Works with both video and image inputs

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based detection)
- Jupyter Notebook (for testing and visualization)
